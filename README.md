# travel_plus_plus
This was a part of Big Data Programming Lab-2 project. For our project, we wanted to build an ultimate, up-to-date guide for all travel related information and also visualise them on a world map. This code is used to find popular restaurants, hotels and nightlife from yelp which was later used for visualisation using tablaeu.
